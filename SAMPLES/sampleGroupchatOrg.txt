# The name of the groupchat will be the groupchat Id because that is the easiest way to do this. 

# 1st line: A stringified list of the members (USERIDS of the groupchat) 

ex. 

["User1", "User2", "User3", "..."]

# 2nd line: The date of groupchat CREATION: PROVIDED AGAIN AS A STRINGIFIED TUPLES 

ex.

THEN: FOR EVERY MESSAGE: 

The order shall go as shown: 

First line: message content
Second line: UserId of person who sent the message
Third Line: the time the message was sent. Time will be in EST so that @ShreyasAngadi has to deal with it and not me. 

ex. 

Hello!
User1
((12,3,2023), (9,35,"pm"))

# Note: 

# The Date and time are provided as stringified TUPLES: 
# This is for connection with potential future APIs or external programs. Why send in as a python time object when that does not translate to java. 
# Reason for no lists is rather simple, our date and time ned not be mutable there is no reason to modify this data after it is originally written. 
# Not to mention the size will never change. 
# Not only is this a failsafe to guard against poor code written by me and Vihas, it also takes less storage to process a tuple. 

# Low level memory saves like these will reduce costs significantly. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
